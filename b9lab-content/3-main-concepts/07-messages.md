# Messages

<HighlightBox type="">

In this section, you will take a closer look at messages, `Msg`. It is recommended to take a look at the following previous sections to better understand messages:

* [A Blockchain App Architecture](./02-architecture.md)
* [Accounts](./04-accounts.md)
* [Transactions](./05-transactions.md)

At the end of the section, you can find a code example illustrating message creation and the inclusion of messages in transactions for our checkers' blockchain.

Understanding `Msg`, will help you prepare for the [next section on modules in the Cosmos SDK](./08-modules.md) as messages are a primary object handled by modules.

</HighlightBox>

Messages are one of two primary objects handled by a module in the Cosmos SDK. The other primary object handled by modules is queries. While messages inform the state and have the potential to alter it (state mutating), queries inspect the module state and are always read-only.

In the Cosmos SDK, a **transaction** contains **one or more messages**. After the transaction is included in a block by the consensus layer, the module processes the messages.

<ExpansionPanel title="Signing a message">

Remember from the [last section on transactions](./05-transactions.md) that transactions must be signed before a validators includes them in a block. Every message in a transaction must be signed by the addresses, as specified by `GetSigners`.

The Cosmos SDK currently allows signing transactions with either `SIGN_MODE_DIRECT` or `SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON`.

When an account signs a message, it, in effect, signs an array of bytes. This array of bytes is the results when serializing the message. For the signature to be verifiable at a later date, this conversion needs to be deterministic. For this reason, you define a canonical bytes representation of the message, typically with the parameters ordered alphabetically.

</ExpansionPanel>

## Messages and the transaction lifecycle

Transactions, containing one or more valid messages, are serialized and confirmed by the Tendermint consensus engine. Recall, that Tendermint is agnostic to the transaction interpretation and has absolute finality. When a transaction is included in a block, it is confirmed, and finalized (no possibility of chain re-organization or cancellation).

The confirmed transaction is relayed to the Cosmos SDK application for interpretation. The `BaseApp`, you use to develop custom modules, attends to the first stages of interpretation. `BaseApp` decodes each message contained in the transaction.

Each message is routed to the appropriate module via `BaseApp`â€™s `MsgServiceRouter`. Each module has its own `MsgService` that processes each received message.

## `MsgService`

Although it is technically feasible to create a novel `MsgService`, the recommended approach is to define a Protobuf `Msg` service. Each module will have exactly one Protobuf `Msg` service defined in `tx.proto` and there is a RPC service method for each message type in the module. Implicitly, the Protobuf message service defines the interface layer of the state mutating processes contained within the module.

How does all of this translate into code? This is an example `MsgService`:

```protobuf
// Msg defines the bank Msg service.
service Msg {
  // Send defines a method for sending coins from one account to another account.
  rpc Send(MsgSend) returns (MsgSendResponse);

  // MultiSend defines a method for sending coins from some accounts to other accounts.
  rpc MultiSend(MsgMultiSend) returns (MsgMultiSendResponse);
}
```

In the above example, we can see that:

* Each `Msg` service method has exactly **one argument**, such as `MsgSend`, which must implement the `sdk.Msg` interface and a Protobuf response.
* The **standard naming convention** is to call the RPC argument `Msg<service-rpc-name>` and the RPC response `Msg<service-rpc-name>Response`.

## Client and server code generation

The Cosmos SDK uses Protobuf definitions to generate client and server code:

* The `MsgServer` interface defines the server API for the `Msg` service. Its implementation is described in the [`Msg` services documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/building-modules/msg-services.html).
* Structures are generated for all RPC request and response types.

## Next up

You can have a look at the code example below to get a better sense of how the above translates in development. In case you feel ready to dive into the next main concept of the Cosmos SDK, you can head straight to the [next section](./08-modules) to learn more about modules.

<ExpansionPanel title="Show me code for my checkers' blockchain - Including messages">

Previously, the ABCI application knew of a single transaction type: that of a checkers move with four `int` values. With multiple games, this is no longer sufficient, nor viable. Additionally, because you are on your way to use the Cosmos SDK, you need to conform to the SDK's way of handling `Tx`. So to say, you have to **create messages that are then included in a transaction**.

## What you need

Let's begin by describing the messages you need for your checkers application to have a solid starting point before diving into the code:

1. In the former _Play_ transaction, your four `int`s need to move from the transaction to an `sdk.Msg` wrapped in said transaction. Four flat `int`s are no longer sufficient as you need to follow the `sdk.Msg` interface, identify the game for which a move is meant, and distinguish a move message from other message types.
2. You need to add a message type for creating a new game. When this is done, a player will create a new game and this new game will mention the other player(s). A generated ID, which should be returned to the message creator as a courtesy, helps identify this newly created game.
3. It is a welcomed idea to allow the other player to reject the challenge (new game), as it brings the added benefit of clearing the state of stale, un-started games.

## How to proceed

Now, have a closer look at the messages around the **game creation**:

1. The message itself is coded:

    ```go
    type MsgCreateGame struct {
        Creator string
        Red     string
        Black   string
    }
    ```

Where `Creator` contains the address of the message signer.

2. The corresponding response message would then be:

    ```go
    type MsgCreateGameResponse struct {
        IdValue string
    }
    ```

With the messages defined, you need to declare how the message should be handled. This involves:

1. Describing how the messages are serialized.
2. Writing the code that handles the message and creates the new game in the storage.
3. Putting hooks and callbacks at the right places in the general message handling.

Fortunately, **Starport** can assist you by creating a boilerplate for message serialization and correct hook and callback implementation, so to say points 1 and 3.

If you want to go beyond these out-of-context code samples and instead see more in detail how all this should be defined, head to the chapter [My Own Chain](../5-my-own-chain/01-index).

</HighlightBox>

In fact, Starport can also help you create the `MsgCreateGame` and `MsgCreateGameResponse` objects with the following command:

```sh
$ starport scaffold message createGame red black --module checkers --response idValue
```

Starport creates a number of other files. For details and to guide you on how to make additions to existing files see the [My Own Chain chapter](../5-my-own-chain/01-index).

### A sample of things Starport took care of

Starport significantly reduces the amount of work a developer has to undertake to build an application with the Cosmos SDK. Among others, it assists with:

1. Getting the signer, the `Creator`, of your message:

    ```go
    func (msg *MsgCreateGame) GetSigners() []sdk.AccAddress {
        creator, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(msg.Creator)
        if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }
       return []sdk.AccAddress{creator}
    }
    ```

Where `GetSigners` is [a requirement of `sdk.Msg`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/1dba673/types/tx_msg.go#L21).

2. Making sure the message's bytes to sign are deterministic:

    ```go
    func (msg *MsgCreateGame) GetSignBytes() []byte {
        bz := ModuleCdc.MustMarshalJSON(msg)
        return sdk.MustSortJSON(bz)
    }
    ```

3. Adding a callback for your new message type in your module's message handler `x/checkers/handler.go`:

    ```go
    ...
    switch msg := msg.(type) {
        ...
        case *types.MsgCreateGame:
            res, err := msgServer.CreateGame(sdk.WrapSDKContext(ctx), msg)
            return sdk.WrapServiceResult(ctx, res, err)
        ...
    }
    ```

4. Creating an empty shell of a file, `x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_create_game.go`, for you to include your code and the response message:

    ```go
    func (k msgServer) CreateGame(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgCreateGame) (*types.MsgCreateGameResponse, error) {
        ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

        // TODO: Handling the message
        _ = ctx

        return &types.MsgCreateGameResponse{}, nil
    }
    ```

## What is left to do?

Most is done. Still, you want to create the game to replace `// TODO: Handling the message`. For this:

1. Decide on how to create a new and unique game ID: `newIndex`.
2. Extract and verify addresses, such as:

    ```go
    red, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(msg.Red)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, errors.New("invalid address for red")
    }
    ```

3. Create a game object with all required parameters - see the [modules section](./08-modules) for the declaration of this object:

    ```go
    storedGame := {
        Creator:   creator,
        Index:     newIndex,
        Game:      rules.New().String(),
        Red:       red,
        Black:     black,
    }
    ```

4. Send it to storage - see the [modules section](./08-modules) for the declaration of this function:

    ```go
    k.Keeper.SetStoredGame(ctx, storedGame)
    ```

5. Return the expected message:

    ```go
    return &types.MsgCreateGameResponse{
        IdValue: newIndex,
    }, nil
    ```

Not to forget, and it is worth mentioning here:

* If you encounter an internal error, you should `panic("This situation should not happen")`.
* If you encounter a user or _regular_ error (for example, not enough funds), you should return a regular `error`.

## Other messages

You can opt to implement other messages. Without repeating all of the above, you can decide to include:

1. The **play message** to implicitly accept the challenge when playing for the first time. If you create it with Starport use:

    ```sh
    $ starport scaffold message playMove idValue fromX:uint fromY:uint toX:uint toY:uint --module checkers --response idValue
    ```

    Which yields, among others, the object files, callbacks, and a new file for you to include your code in:

    ```go
    func (k msgServer) PlayMove(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgPlayMove) (*types.MsgPlayMoveResponse, error) {
        ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

        // TODO: Handling the message
        _ = ctx

        return &types.MsgPlayMoveResponse{}, nil
    }
    ```

2. The **reject message**, only valid if the player never played any moves in this game. Again, if you create it with Starport:

    ```sh
    $ starport scaffold message rejectGame idValue --module checkers
    ```

    It yields, among others:

    ```go
    func (k msgServer) RejectGame(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgRejectGame) (*types.MsgRejectGameResponse, error) {
        ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

        // TODO: Handling the message
        _ = ctx

        return &types.MsgRejectGameResponse{}, nil
    }
    ```

## Other considerations

You can already begin contemplating game-theoretical situations for your checkers application. After all, a game involves two parties/players, and they may not always play nice.

What would happen if one of the two players has accepted the game by playing, but the other player has neither accepted nor rejected the game? You can address this scenario by:

* Having a timeout after which the game is canceled. This cancelation could be handled automatically in ABCI's `EndBlock`, or rather its equivalent in the Cosmos SDK, without any of the players having to trigger the cancelation.
* Keeping an index, a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) list, or a list of un-started games ordered by their cancelation time, so that this automatic trigger does not consume too many resources.

What would happen if the player, whose turn it is, never shows up or never sends a valid transaction? To ensure functionality for your checkers application, consider:

* Having a timeout after which the game is forfeited. You could also automatically charge the forgetful player, if and when you implement a wager system.
* Keeping an index of games that could be forfeited. If both timeouts are the same, you can keep a single FIFO list of games to clear from the head as necessary.

In pseudo-code: you add `timeout: Timestamp` to your `StoredGame` and update it every time something changes in the game. You can decide on a maximum delay: what about one day?

Note that there are no _open_ challenges, meaning a player creates a game where the second player is unknown until someone steps in. Player matching is left outside of the blockchain. To incorporate it in-chain, you would have to change all models.
