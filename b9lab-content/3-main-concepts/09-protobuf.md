# Protobuf

## Long-running exercise

We have defined a number of data types: our transactions and our `FullGame`. Perhaps it is time to define them in Protobuf so as to enjoy its serialization facilities.

We try to reuse the pre-existing `Game` if possible. Otherwise, we provide a transformer so as to reuse the rules code.

TODO code detail.
