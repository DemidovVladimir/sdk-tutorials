# Gas Metering

As of now, players can start playing checkers with your Cosmos blockchain. They have to pay transaction fees. At least the fee related to transporting the serialized bytes and the other metered parts, like bank. How about you add your own gas fees to reflect the different costs different transactions impose. Or you add costs to discourage spam.

## New Information

Let's say you landed on values you think are reasonable. Save them in `x/checkers/types/keys.go`:

```go
const (
    CreateGameGas = 10
    PlayMoveGas   = 10
    RejectGameGas = 0
)
```

## Add Handling

This is going to be quick. In each relevant handler, you add a line that consumes the designated amount of gas:

1. In `x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_create_game.go`:
    ```go
    ctx.GasMeter().ConsumeGas(types.CreateGameGas, "Create game")
    ```
2. In `x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_play_move.go`:
    ```go
    ctx.GasMeter().ConsumeGas(types.PlayMoveGas, "Play a move")
    ```
3. In `x/checkers/keeper/msg_server_reject_game.go`:
    ```go
    ctx.GasMeter().ConsumeGas(types.RejectGameGas, "Reject game")
    ```

Of course, you are free to be more elaborate and chisel the conditions that consume. Avoid calling `ConsumeGas` from within a loop, though. Instead, if you know the number of times your code loops, consume all the gas ahead of the loop. With this trick, if the signer had not sent enough gas, the transaction will run out of gas anyway, as if you had run the steps, except you didn't run them, and therefore saved computations on your node.

Okay. Time to move on.
